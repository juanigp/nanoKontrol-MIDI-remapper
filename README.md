# nanoKontrol-MIDI-remapper

Some MIDI remapper tool for the Korg nanoKontrol 2 MIDI controller. Makes possible for the user to have 16 different layouts (associated to a MIDI channel) he can switch whenever he wants without having to load them using Korg's tool.

Uses loopMIDI internal MIDI ports as an intermediate layer between nanoKontrol and the DAW you want to use.

It was intended for personal use so it has no documentation.

Circa 2016
